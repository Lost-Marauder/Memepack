# Memepack
Ramus' Memepack for Minecraft 1.15.2

I got tired of downloading and uploading to Drive, so here we are in the Github, I guess.
To use the QuinnPatch, download the repository and unzip. Move the QuinnPatch folder to the base of the ResourcePack folder. It'll be its own resource pack, so make sure it's on top of the MemePack in the righthand column so it overwrites the language.
